# Personal Website | Dathan Lang

## Important Notes:
- All code and images should be free to use, just don't put my photos or
anything out there without permission. 
- Everything is pretty much set up statically, I have plans to port over to PHP when
I have time!

## Background
Hey welcome to my website! I'm Dathan and I'm a
incoming CS and ITWS dual student @ RPI. I'm interested
in a bunch of things like Scrabble and Jazz and feel free 
to email me. This website is a work in progress and frequently gets changed!

## Information Architecture
- *Still in Development*
